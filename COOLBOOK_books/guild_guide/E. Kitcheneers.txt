%TITLE:E. Kitcheneers

The glory of the kitchen!  Be you a chef or barkeep, this job is part of the face of the guild!  Get out there and fill peoples bellies while keeping them talking.  Keep the party flowing!

Do's

Do make meals and drinks ahead of time.  Quickly being able to offer stuff up is helpful to keeping the flow up at the bar.

Do take time to experiment with food/drinks.  Try to do new things.

Do try to remember what peoples usual requests are, they like knowing that you care.

Do gossip, keep people talking.  Try not to let it be mean gossip of course, but talking patrons are engaged.

Don'ts

Don't encourage barfights, no matter how much you want to see the Knights break it up.

Don't be a downer, if you're not feeling up to being a happy face at the bar maybe stick to the back and cooking foods, or take some time to relax.  Better to have a quiet bar than upset folks.

Don't get too drunk yourself, it's important to be able to call for help if you need to after all.

Don't spike drinks.  This is a great way to get a knight to push your shit in and lose your Guild access.

OOC Notes

ERP
Feel free to shutdown to ERP with either your guildmates or someone else.  Do NOT feel guilty for filling a slot as they're almost universally uncapped.
