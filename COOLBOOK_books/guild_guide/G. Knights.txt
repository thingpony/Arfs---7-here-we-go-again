%TITLE:G. Knights

The Guild Knights are a prestigious group.  Pulled from trusted adventurers and wasters to work with the guild directly.  Your goal is to defend the Guild, your fellow Guild Members, and to
help supress the wildness of the wastes.

Do's

Do be cavalier, this is an adventurers job.  Don't be afraid to go out and get your hands dirty.

Do protect the guild and your guild mates with prejudice, but make sure you response matches the threat.  

Do be willing to protect wasters as well, you are the Guilds sword.  Shine brightly.

Don'ts

Don't be overprotective.  Words of violence mean little, meet violence with violence.  Instead try to defuse situations that haven't lead to violence yet.

Don't be a town guard.  Your duty of defense isn't the town.  Its the Guildhall.  Let the town security do its job.  Though, feel free to work with them if a goal matches.

Don't run off without communicating with your guildmates.  Let them know whats going on.  They may need you at the drop of a hat, so try to stay near if any trouble at all seems possible.

OOC Notes:

ERP
Feel free to shutdown to ERP with either your guildmates or someone else.  Do NOT feel guilty for filling a slot as they're almost universally uncapped.
