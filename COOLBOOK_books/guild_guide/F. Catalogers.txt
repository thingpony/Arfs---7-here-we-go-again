The recording hand of the guild.  You take note of the surrounding area and what it may contain.  Take the time to record this information and store it in the book system.  Feel free, of course, to write
other things as well.  Your job isn't the most exciting but if fulfilled regularly it can help guide the Guilds hand towards problem areas in the wastes.  Along with giving wasters information about their surroundings that 
could lead to them more effectively 'solving' problems for the guild.

Do's

Do be vocal about your purpose and existence.  Hiding in your book nook is a fast track to taking a nap for the whole day.  

Do be inquisitive about the landscape around the town.  You should learn about dungeons that people go to.  Where they are, what kind of foes may be there, what kind of loot it may contain.  The regular portal storms
in this area will reset them regularly and you can use that information to inform the guild and wasters where they may want to go for new gear or to find tickets.

Do be active in recording data.  The database system works and you should use it record things that are useful, or even just entertainment.  Do not be afraid of it, it is your job after all.

Do go out with Knights or adventurers to record first hand data.

Don'ts

Don't be a hermit.  We can't stress this enough, being a quiet background book keeper is not a good way to get anything done unless your plan is to just nap.

Don't be stingy with loaning out books, you really can just make more.

Don't assume an area is fully known even if a book for it exists.  Finding new info and making new editions with fresh info can be quite rewarding.

OOC Notes:

ERP
Feel free to shutdown to ERP with either your guildmates or someone else.  Do NOT feel guilty for filling a slot as they're almost universally uncapped.
