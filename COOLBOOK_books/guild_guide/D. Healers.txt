%TITLE:D. Healers

An overarching title for any number of different medical roles filled by Guild members.  Be you a magical healer or a chemist with deep knowledge of the test tubes.  Be you a therapist or
a surgeon who could glue two monkeys together.  This title fits all of you, and you have a large space to perform your duties in.  Some do's and don'ts follow!

Do's

Do make your presence known to the town, no matter how rare it may be that someone actually comes in it makes people feel safer to know that a doctor of some sort is around.

Do be proactive about making healing materials if you know how.

Do offer healing at low or no price.  You are not the guilds moneymaker.  You are the guilds good grace.  People appreciate what you do and it can be used to ingratiate the guild on the wastes.


--PAGEBREAK--

Don'ts

Don't sell bad chems without being clear what they are.

Don't cheat people with watered down drugs.

Don't finish what you start. If you start healing someone then be sure to finish up, don't just kick them out in the street once they've been sutured without a word.

OOC Notes 

ERP
Feel free to shutdown to ERP with either your guildmates or someone else.  Do NOT feel guilty for filling a slot as they're almost universally uncapped.

Downtime
There's a lot of downtime in the clinic.  Spend that time socializing with the rest of the Guild.  They are your coworkers, and you should probably get to know them!  If you are playing 
in this role and there are other guild members on and you are sitting at the desk bored then YOU are doing that to YOU.  Get up and socialize!  If there's no one else on in the guild then get up and get out.
Sitting at a desk for an hour while you watch youtube videos is about as engaging as picking your nose to solve a math problem.
